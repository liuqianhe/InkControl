# Modes, algorithms, and hysteresis

[简体中文](algorithms.md) · [Wiki](README.en.md)

Every list includes `default`, which preserves the existing path. New overrides default off. Grayscale and binary choices are separate; video is stored independently. Choosing quantization does not switch modes, temperature bands, or waveform counts.

| Scope | External mode | Non-default IDs | Baseline | Independent hysteresis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `clear` | 2 | `stock`, `nearest`, `bayer16` | Existing Clear path | None |
| `reading` | 3; compatible 4/5 | `stock`, `nearest`, `bayer16` | Existing Reading/lock policy | None |
| `fast` | 6 | `bayer`, `blue`, `threshold` | Bayer | Off by default |
| `extreme` | 9 | `bayer`, `blue`, `threshold` | Bayer | Off by default |
| `video` | `0x400` + actual A2 | `blue`, `bayer`, `stock`, `threshold` | Legacy video setting; normally blue | On by default; unavailable for stock |

`stock` means stock 16-level diffusion for grayscale and stock video diffusion for video; the shared ID does not mean the same shader. `nearest` is 16-level point quantization; `bayer16` is 16-level Bayer; `blue` is blue noise; `threshold` is direct binary thresholding.

## Exact video activation

`native/service_algorithm_policy.hpp` first excludes reset, transition, and blank states. It then prioritizes video when `mode & 0x400` is nonzero, `(selected & 255) == 8`, and `internal == 8`. Ordinary interception additionally requires matching external/internal selections: Clear 2/2, Reading 5/5, Fast/Extreme 8/8.

High visual motion alone does not activate video. Framework video/camera state affects the flag; HWC mode and telemetry establish the path actually used. Lifecycle flag cleanup is a separate fix. A playback screenshot is insufficient evidence.

## Hysteresis and persistence

Hysteresis uses the previous frame to stabilize binary pixels near a threshold. It is available for Bayer, blue noise, and direct thresholding, with `default/on/off`. Stock video has its own history behavior, which this additional switch does not control. Grayscale has no such option. Judge stability/detail tradeoffs on the physical panel.

Feature IDs are `display.alg.<scope>` and `display.hyst.<scope>`; backend properties are `debug.eink.alg.<scope>` and `debug.eink.hyst.<scope>`. They depend on `display.gpu` and apply hot. Legacy `experiment.video` remains compatible. Disabling overrides explicitly restores `default`.

An ordinary Bayer hysteresis equality boundary at threshold minus 12 now uses integer comparison; legacy video math remains unchanged. Stock video can run on the GPU but its row-dependent diffusion is much slower than blue. Slowness is not proof of CPU fallback.

rc11 passed 59 standalone comparisons on both target Mali and software GLES. This does not prove integrated HWC behavior, every stock-history state, or panel stability. Sources: `R01`–`R03`; code: `DisplayAlgorithms.java`, `FeatureCatalog.java`, `service_algorithm_policy.hpp`, `service_gpu.cpp`.
